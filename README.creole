build support for Go language in Emacs.

When you open a Go file in a standard Go project format this should
set your compile command correctly.

=== Todo ===

Make compile-mode handle Go's output properly.

Maybe we could have a default Go project setup, something that made a
new directory, git init'ed there and put in src, bin, etc...
